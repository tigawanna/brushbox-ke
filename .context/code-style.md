- prefer named functions unless if in inside other functions
- custom hooks files should use this format`use-scroll-direction`
- we're using motion formerly known asframer motion
-we're using tailwindcss = daisyui so adhere to the daisyui colr variables and avoid hard coding colrs where possible
- prefer named export from compoments unlss if deafult export is necessary
- we are using typescript and all function inputs should have type annotations
 - we're using react with nextjs and react server copnets where possible
 - the backend / cms is pocketbase with tyed pocketbse
- do not use framer motion in server components especialy in root pages it requires a "use client" directive and it' not best practie to put it at the page level
